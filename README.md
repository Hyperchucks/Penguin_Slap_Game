# Penguin_Slap_Game v7

<h1>Project Description: </h1>

Side-scrolling platform game in development. This game is a project that is used as a base game and its being changed to make a more complete game using ActionScript 3.0. Through the development of this game we have learned how to do certain elements of the code to make the game behave how we want it to behave. The game is still in very early stages and will be modify even more until we have a complete and more robust version of the game.



<h1>What is it about?</h1>

The player is in a form of a penguin. The enemies are smaller penguins that are trying to stop the player from reaching the Fish at the end of the stage. The player can slap the enemies or jump over them to avoid contact with the enemy. There are some gold fish tokens that will grant health to the player if the player is missing health from fighting the enemies. Once the player reach the Fish at the end, it will win.

<h1>Future Plans</h1>

We are planning to incorporate several changes to the game:
* Event for player reaching the Fish
* Adding Bosses
* New Levels
* Changing Sounds

So much more to come as we discover new things to add to the game to make it more enjoyable and challenging at the same time.
